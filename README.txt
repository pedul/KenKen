To run the project open the solution file LearnKenKen.sln in Visual Studio.
The project is of type ASP.NET Web Application and is written in C# and ASP.NET (webforms) using Visual Web Developer 2010 Express.

My program is not exactly a typical computerized solution to KenKen. Instead it moves one step at a time and mimics the way a human being (mostly me) would solve this puzzle. This also means that the success of this approach is limited by my ability to solve the puzzle.

I personally have not been able to solve a 7 x 7 hard puzzle and hence, my program cannot solve it either (any help appreciated !). The solution also does not use backtracking because although it is very easy for a computer, it is very hard for a human being after a certain level.
